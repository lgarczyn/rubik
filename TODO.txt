optimizing
	multithreading
	check cache misses
		cachegrind
heuristic
	figure out htf do I divide the distance
		if 7 are out of lines, it's actually worse than 8
		sometimes
		is the multiplier really 8 ?
		I mean seriously, maybe it's 4 considering the max
	maybe relative distance instead of absolute
		that way the computer tries to place a border between corners instead of not
			maybe for invalid
			each corners has 3 corner neighbours && 3 border neighbours
			each side has 2 corner neighbours and 2 center neighbours
			each center has 4 borders and 4 corners
	the ideal heuristic would realize that the square can
		go directly to the target (center)
		go to a friend(border/center), that can be moved to the center/
		maybe corners try to move next to their borders instead?
	considering corner parity

	direct color input
		get cube_id
		check presence

is it getcube id ?

Square -> Cubie/Facelet
Data -> Cubies
Cube -> Faces
ID -> IdG0
IDG1 -> IdG1
IDG2 -> IdG2
ID -> Id
State (only 18, is it worth the unique identifier ?) -> StateId
Id vs Coord ?
Should State handle Data ?
