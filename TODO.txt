    selective heuristic
        do max(a/4) heuristic first
    loop
        imply iterate over ids
optimizing
    multithreading
        fix crash
    swap instead of delete
        requires container for StateRef
            would also remove the StateRef(new State())
        check with google array
    check cache misses
heuristic

    check square don't take seperate paths
        yeah I don't think so
    optimize squares taken in account
    use the max(a/4, b/4) heuristic
