    v indexing
        v kinda already have something maybe
    calculating
        no idea, probably a whole week to make it work
optimizing
    multithreading
    google array https://github.com/sparsehash/sparsehash
    swap instead of delete
        requires container for StateRef
            would also remove the StateRef(new State())
    maybe make movement a Movement[20] array
    check cache misses
heuristic
    check square don't take seperate paths
        yeah I don't think so
    optimize squares taken in account
    use the max(a/4, b/4) heuristic
    multithreading
